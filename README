The library librtipc includes several shared memory based objects for 
realtime-capable inter-process communication. These objects were implemented 
especially for situations where processes with different levels of real-time 
requirements have to communicate. 

In addition to some basic synchronization mechanisms the library includes 
several queue objects with lock-free and some of them even with wait-free 
characteristics. 

Currently, the implementation of the library is available for x86 and ARMv7 
CPU architectures and runs on the Linux operating system. To simplify porting 
of the library, an abstraction layer for hardware and operating system 
functionalities has been introduced.

 IPC Objects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IPC Objects:
 - Mutex
 - Barrier
 - Flag
 - wait-free single-producer single-consumer queue
 - wait-free multi-producer single-consumer queue (*)
 - lock-free multi-producer multi-consumer queue
 - lock-free multi-producer single-consumer queue
 - sensor-buffer object for a wait-free writer and a lock-free consumer

 
(*) on ARMv7: lock-free producer and wait-free consumer

 Build
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. set up some symlinks:

./configure <arch> <system>

available options:
<arch> x86, arm
<system> linux


2. build

make

 Demo Applications
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectories 'demo' and 'benchmark' contain some examples on how to use 
librtipc. Most of the benchmarks will need root privileges to run. But be 
carful when running them: Some of them will clear the interrupt flag for some 
time, so your system will freeze for some time (or forever in case of any 
error).
